# Course Notes
This repository includes some note templates for my courses. It is intended for shared notetaking. Every semester, I create a folder for courses that I am teaching. Each folder contains a template that students can copy. 
## Usage
- To take notes, create a copy of the template file. 
- Please name every new note file by date so that students can easily find the notes for dates of class they may have missed.
- I also suggest adding tags for the content covered that day in the metadata to make it easier to find notes by topic.
