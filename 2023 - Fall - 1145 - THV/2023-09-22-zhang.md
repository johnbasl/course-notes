Google is implementing a LLM throught their services (help you write emails, search, etc)
- issue: hallucinations (LLMs make up information)
- current solution: run it through a Google search

If you tell an LLM to "take a deep breath and try again" when solving a math problem, it will do better

## Relativism
There are no objective (mind-independent) moral truths

All ethical truths are relative

No philosophers believe in cultural relativism

### Argument from mystery
1. It is difficult/mysterious to see what could make moral claims true or false other than opinion
2. If it is difficult to see what could make moral claims true, then relativism is true

-- CONCLUSION --

3. Therefore, morality is just a matter of opinion/ moral truths are relevant to peopleâ€™s opinions (relativism is true)

Justifications/objections
- Premise 1:
  - when there is disagreement, it's difficult
- Premise 2:
  - disagreement gives you a *right to opinion*, and opinion is similar to relativism
  - if objective truth is difficult to understand, that truth is relative

### Argument from disagreement
1. If there is disagreement over ethical issues, then relativism is true
2. There is a disagreement over ethical issues

-- CONCLUSION --

3. Therefore, relativism is true

Justifications/objections
- Premise 1:
  - backed by tolerance
  - when there is disagreement, then relative
- Premise 2:
  - there are some areas of significant overlap
  - moral disagreement is illusionary

### Argument from tolerance
1. If we should be tolerant of the moral views of others, relativism is true
2. We should be tolerant of the moral views of others

-- CONCLUSION --

3. Therefore, relativism is true

Justifications/objections
- Premise 1:
  - relativism cannot say what is right or wrong
- Premise 2:
  - we should not tolerate genocidal culture

## Against relativism
### Argument from progress
1. If relativism is true, then (intercultural) moral progress is not possible
2. (Intercultural) moral progress is possible

-- CONCLUSION --

3. Therefore, relativism is false

Intercultural vs intracultural progress
We regress all the time, so progress must be relative to a standard

Justifications/objections
- Premise 2:
  - ex: abolition, suffrage

### Argument from character of moral dispute
1. Moral dispute has the character of objective dispute
2. If moral dispute has the character of objective dispute, presumption in favor of thinking morality is objective

-- CONCLUSION --

3. So, presumption in favor of thinking morality is objective

Justifications/objections
- Premise 1:
  - false, ex: favorite cookie vs abortion

## Legitimacy
Democratic trolley optimism
### Argument from legitimacy
1. The legitimate exercise of coercive authority requires democratic procedures
2. If the legitimate exercise of coercive authority requires democratic procedures, we should vote to decide moral issues
-- CONCLUSION --
3. So, we should vote to decide moral issues

Justifications/objections
- Premise 1:
  - public reasons (Rawls: liberalism)
  - reasonable pluralism
- Premise 2:
  - we vote for representatives who make the moral decisions, so we are not voting on the moral issues
