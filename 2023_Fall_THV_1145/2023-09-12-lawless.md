Main Topics within Autonomous Systems:

**Autonomous Vehicles**
- Accident scenarios
- Employment
	- replacing human jobs (e.g. trucker, train operator, pilot)
- Research and development
- Laws
	- Breaking the law (e.g. crossing a double yellow line to avoid a cyclist on the road)
	- following the laws too strictly (e.g. stopping at every stop sign for at least 3 seconds)
	- Google found their cars had higher accident rates from following laws too strictly
- Oversight
	- Who controls the vehicles?
	- How do we make sure companies are transparent about their systems?
- Responsibility
	- If an autonomous vehicle injures someone, who is at fault?
- Exacerbate inequalities between rich and poor
- Saving lives by reducing accidents on the road
- Trust
	- How do we make these systems trust worthy?
	- How do we not lose out on the benefits of autonomous vehicles?
	- How do we encourage people to trust/adopt this technology?

**Autonomous Weapons Systems**
- Responsibility gap
